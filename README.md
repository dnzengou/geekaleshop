<!--## Full Specs

With our team expanding and given the fact that we have distributed teams in Greece and USA, our team members need to find and use other members' contact info with a quick and easy way.

You will need to prepare three sections of the service: the contacts list, the contact profile and the create a new contact form. Nevertheless, feel free to add any additional section, data or ways to build a better UX for our team.


### Contact List

The user should be able to see a list of all the available contacts of the organization. Each contact should have a summary of details visible (avatar, contact name, job position), a link to the full contact profile and actions to delete or edit each contact.

You can add any other feature you think would easy teammates communication.

### Contact Profile

By clicking on a contact list item will lead to a page that offers more details about this contact. On this page, users should be able to see:

* Avatar
* Full Name
* Email address
* Job Position
* Address

As for the contacts list page, the above sections are required for this assignment.

In addition, user should have the option to save this contact as a favorite.

### Contact Form

User should have the option to create a new contact at any time.
The mandatory fields will be:

* Full Name
* Email address

The form will include some optional fields like:
* Address

As to the previous pages, the above items are required.

### Assets

We provide you an unstyled contact management application with some basic content. You should evaluate the given content and build up on it, either by proposing extra feature or re-framing existing ones.

## Deliverables

### HTML/CSS Templating Exercise

A fully working prototype of contact management tool implemented with html/less.
Your solution will be judged based on the requirements listed above and on your code quality, naming scheme and consistency.

HTML/CSS implementation should take into consideration:

* Utilization of less (preprocessor) benefits
* CSS Code breakdown and easy of extensibility/maintenance
* CSS Logic and how any frameworks were used
* HTML structure

In case you don't jump into the javascript exercises feel free to use fake data to complete the HTML markup.

Use any setup/package manager/task manager you feel comfortable with, but please include an installation file in this repository.

### Javascript Exercises

* Implement the application logic for the delete operation at controller.js
* Add one more field at all templates and models (eg. linkedIn link)
* Implement the logic for favor/unfavor.
* Reorder the contact list with favorites on top (do it with marionette)


It is not required to solve any javascript question, and if you do, solve up to your level.

You won’t be judged for the aesthetic of the final design, but is really important to see the way you could contribute by making some design-oriented decisions.

You may use third-party libraries but please make sure they don’t shadow your final work.

You will be given access to a private repo of our company and all deliverables should be committed there.
